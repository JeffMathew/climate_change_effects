# Socio-economic factors and climate change
Project studies the correlation between countries adversely affected by climate change and various socio-economic factors.

This project also leveraged a handy machine learning/data analysis tool `Weka` to iterate the modelling process quickly. `Weka` is great when working with tabular data and allows experiments to be set up in record time.
